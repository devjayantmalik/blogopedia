      <h1>The Plane Tree</h1>
      <p>
        Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a
        widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant
        leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit
        whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here
        in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O
        Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"
