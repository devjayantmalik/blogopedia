                    A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying
                    home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a
                    narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself
                    reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the
                    greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much
                    bigger than his own.
